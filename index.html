        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p>Fires tearing through the Sequoia National Park in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15568097/what-caused-2021-wildfires-california-oregon/">California</a> have got to within a mile of the Giant Forest, a grove of 2,000 giant sequoias.</p>

        <p>Forecasters expect cooler weather, low winds but little rain this weekend.</p>

        <p>The fire service’s Rebecca Paterson said: “We anticipate the fires will continue to grow, hopefully not too fast.”</p>

        <p>Sequoias are adapted to fires as they release seeds from their cones into the burnt clearings for new trees.</p>

        <p>But drought, tied to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/climate-change-environment/"> climate change</a>, is making blazes so fierce they overwhelm the trees.</p>
